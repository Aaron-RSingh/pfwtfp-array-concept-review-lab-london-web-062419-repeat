# Array Concept Review Lab

## Learning Goals
- Perform operations on arrays as guided by tests
- Reflect on approach

## Introduction
In this lab we are going to practice array operations. 

### Perform operations on Arrays as guided by tests
* Find a max
* Extract the nth elements of nested arrays
* Flatten nested array
* Flatten nested array, then return reverse alphabetically sorted


### Reflect on Approach
* Did you use the built-in? Why not?
* Knowing your builtins saves you time, prevents bugs, and is what other developers will expect to see you use when writing

## Conclusion
